# Violet-Task-manager-
A quick Ai controlled app the makes taking quick notes and calendar task easy and functional 
Violet Task Manager is a simple, fast productivity app made for people who are constantly on the move. It’s written mostly in Swift using SwiftUI, and uses Firebase for login and syncing. There's no fluff—just a clean interface and a smart engine behind it.

The main feature is called TouchNow. Basically, you just open the app, type whatever’s on your mind—whether it’s a task, reminder, or something random and the built in neural engine (powered by Open AI API) will try to figure out what to do with it. It'll suggest whether it should be on your calendar, saved as a note, or something else. Then, when you have more time, you can go into TouchNow and adjust the details—like timing, format, etc.

It's a task manager app or a productivity app that's meant to be very easy to use without a learning curve like most productivity apps out there, but still able to do a wide range of complex tasks while also using AI to make it even more efficient with efficiently forming calendar reminders and easily formatted notes.

Just a heads up—this app is for personal use only. It’s not meant for commercial use or repurposing.
